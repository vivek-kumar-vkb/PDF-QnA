People held him in awe, until\\nhe opened his mouth. He spoke his mind, hardly able to control his arrogance and\\nboastfulness. He slandered and insulted people. The more speeches he made, the\\nless people respected him. He suffered the people’s wrath and was eventually\\nbanished from the city.\\n• Observance of the Law\\nMasters of enigma Andy Warhol and Marcel Duchamp knew the power of saying less\\nand keeping people guessing. The less Duchamp talked about his work, the more it\\nwas talked about in the art circles. Andy Warhol recognized it was hard to talk people\\ninto doing what you wanted, so when interviewed, he would give vague and\\nambiguous answers and let the interviewer find his own interpretation.\\nWisdom in a nutshell:\\n• Saying less will keep you from saying something foolish or even dangerous.\\n• Once the words are out you cannot take them back.\\n• Keeping silent makes people reveal more about themselves. This is information\\nyou may be able to use against them later on.\\n5. SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION – GUARD IT WITH YOUR\\nLIFE.\\n• Observance of the Law\\nDuring China’s War of the Three Kingdoms (A.D.207-265), General Liang was able to\\nfool his rival Sima Yi simply by letting his track record for being an undefeated leader\\nin battle do the work for him. Liang’s troops were far outnumbered by Sima Yi’s, yet\\nhe devised a clever last resort plan. Liang donned a Taoist robe and played the lute\\nupon the wall of the city he was defending. His soldiers opened the gates and hid.\\nWhen Sima Yi’s troops advanced upon the unguarded city, Yi recognized his\\nopponent sitting alone upon the wall. Fearing a trap, Sima Yi called his soldiers to\\nretreat.\\nP.T. Barnum was an expert at destroying his competitor’s reputation. He published\\nletters in newspapers, warning the public against buying his opponent’s stock. He\\nwas a master at poking mockery at the tactics of his rivals.\\nWisdom in a nutshell:\\n• Sow doubt and spread rumors about your rival. Even if they vehemently deny it,\\npeople will still be wondering why they are so defensive.\\n• Use humor or gentle mockery at your rival’s expense.\\n• A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your strengths\\nwithout your having to spend much energy.\\n• Never appear desperate in your self-defense against the slander of others.\\n• Be careful not to go too far in attacking another’s reputation, it draws more\\nattention to your vengefulness than to the person you are slandering. Use subtler\\ntactics like satire and ridicule.\\n6.

       "  Document(page_content='The 48 Laws Of Power Page 9\\nThis law is most appreciated in matters of seduction and love. Make yourself too\\navailable and your presence will be taken for granted. In the Middle Ages, ladies played\\nthe game of presence and absence by sending their knights off on long arduous quests.\\nSir Guillaume de Balaun wanted to taste the joy of love after reconciliation, and twice he\\nintentionally made himself scarce, withdrawing his affections from Madame Guillelma de\\nJaviac. The first time he drove his lover wild with grief, the second time she became\\nangry and cut him off. When he wrote her begging to be let back into her favor, she\\nallowed him back only on the condition he do penance for his cruelty.\\nWith business, an early retirement at the height of your career will keep people holding\\nyou in high regard, and waiting to see you make a comeback.\\nWisdom in a nutshell:\\n• Create value through scarcity. Make yourself less accessible; otherwise the aura\\nyou have created around yourself will wear away.\\n17. KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF\\nUNPREDICTABILITY.\\n• Observance of the Law\\nBobby Fischer beat chess champion Boris Spassky using this law of unpredictability.\\nSpassky’s method of playing chess was to base his strategy on the patterns he read in\\nhis opponent’s moves. Fischer unnerved him by arriving late for the first two tournaments,\\neven letting a match get forfeited. On the third game he made moves that were so\\nuncharacteristic and bold Spassky was thrown off balance. Fourteen games later\\nSpassky claimed Fischer was probably putting drugs in the orange juice they drank while\\nplaying. Spassky resigned a few months later and never recovered from his defeat.\\nWisdom in a nutshell:\\n• A person of power instills fear by deliberately unsettling those around him to keep\\nthe initiative on his side.\\n• Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner.\\n18. DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF –\\nISOLATION IS DANGEROUS.\\n• Observance of the Law\\nKing Louis XIV recognized the importance of always keeping his eyes and ears on\\neveryone and everything around him. He built a palace in Versailles where all the nobility\\ncould keep apartments near to his. He knew that if he were to isolate himself for one\\nmoment, conspiracies would rise behind his back. The daily activities all revolved around\\nthe king, leaving no one unnoticed, hundreds of visitors and attendants were always\\npresent.

CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS.\\n• Transgression of the Law.\\nThe Marquis de Sevigne was young and inexperienced in the art of love. He confided\\nin the infamous courtesan of seventeenth-century France, Ninon de Lenclos, to\\ninstruct him on how to seduce a difficult young countess. She made him follow a plan\\nover a number of weeks, where the Marquis would be appearing in public always\\nsurrounded by beautiful women, in the very places the countess would be expected\\nto see him. He was supposed to assume an air of nonchalance. This increased the\\njealousy of the young countess, who was not sure of his interest in her. One day the\\nMarquis, unable to control his passion, broke from Ninon’s plan, and blurted out to\\nthe countess that he loved her. After this admission, the countess no longer found\\nhim interesting and avoided him.\\n• Observance of the Law\\nOtto von Bismarck was a deputy in the Prussian parliament at a time when many\\nfellow deputies thought it was possible to go to war against Austria and defeat it.\\nBismarck knew the Prussian army was not prepared, so he devised a clever way to\\nkeep the war at bay. He publicly stated his praises for the Austrians and talked about\\nthe madness of war. Many deputies changed their votes. Had Bismarck announced\\nhis real intentions, arguing it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not have\\nwon. Most Prussians wanted to go to war at that moment and mistakenly believed\\ntheir army to be superior to the Austrians. Had he gone to the king his sincerity would\\nhave been doubted. By giving misleading statements about wanting peace and\\nconcealing his true purpose, Bismarck’s speech catapulted him to the position of\\nprime minister. He later led the country to war against the Austrians at the right time,\\nwhen he felt the Prussian army was more capable.\\nWisdom in a nutshell:\\n• Use decoyed objects of desire and red herrings to throw people off scent.\\n• Use smoke screens (a poker face) to disguise your actions.\\n• False sincerity is one powerful tool that will send your rivals on a wild goose\\nchase.\\n• Publicly declare your false intentions to give misleading signals.\\n• A noble gesture can be a smoke screen to hide your true intentions.\\n• Blend in and people will be less suspicious.\\n4.

       "  Document(page_content='The 48 Laws Of Power Page 12\\nJulius Caesar always incorporated drama and theatrics in his speeches and daily\\nappearances. He was a great public showman, timing his entrances and exits,\\nsponsoring extravagant spectacles, gladiator shows and theatrical events. The masses\\nloved him, but his rivals feared him.\\nAurore Dupin Dudevant left her husband and family in the provinces to become a writer in\\nParis, something unheard of and almost impossible for a woman to do in 1831. For the\\npublication of her novel Indiana, she assumed the pseudonym George Sand. She\\ndressed in men’s breeches, smoked cigars, and expressed herself in conversation like a\\nman. She even carried on affairs with the most famous artists of Europe - Musset, Liszt,\\nand Chopin - living with freedom and independence unlike any other female writer before\\nher.\\nWisdom in a nutshell:\\n• Control your appearances and emotions. Play sincere, but not necessarily be\\nsincere.\\n• Create a memorable character. Do not limit yourself to the role society assigns to\\nyou.\\n26. KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN.\\nObservance of the Law:\\nCleopatra was always able to get people to do her bidding without them realizing she was\\nmanipulating them. She was able to charm Julius Caesar into restoring her to the throne\\nof Egypt, and playing her siblings against each other. Marc Antony was seduced by her,\\nand had her younger sister Arsinoe executed, ridding Cleopatra of any threats to her\\nplace as Queen.\\nWisdom in a nutshell:\\n• Conceal your mistakes. Your good name and reputation depends more on what you\\nconceal than on what you reveal.\\n• Always have a convenient scapegoat.\\n• Never do the dirty work yourself.\\n27. PLAY ON PEOPLE’S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A CULT-LIKE\\nFOLLOWING.\\nWisdom in a nutshell:\\n• Keep it simple; keep it vague. Create new words for vague concepts.\\n• Emphasize the visual and sensual over the intellectual.\\n• Borrow the forms of organized religion to structure the group. Create rituals. Use\\nnames and ranks and titles. Ask them to make sacrifices and give alms. Act like a\\nguru or a prophet.\\n• Disguise your source of income.\\n• Set up an us-versus-them dynamic. Keep followers united by identifying outsiders as\\na devious enemy.\\n• The tendency to doubt and reason is broken down when we join a group.\\n28. ENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS.\\nIvan the Terrible waited five years before executing his first major bold move. After years\\nof persecution by the Shuisky family, the poisoning of his mother Helena, and the\\nbanishment of his only friend Vorontsov, the thirteen year-old Ivan invited his rival Prince\\nAndrei Shuisky into his room. No one feared the young boy and the boyars often ridiculed\\nhim. When the guards were suddenly ordered to seize Prince Andrei and execute him, no\\none saw it coming. This one swift and bold act secured Ivan’s power for decades to\\ncome.\\nwww.bizsum.com © 2001, 2002 Copyright BusinessSummaries.com', metadata={'Author': 'che.roces', 'CreationDate': \"D:20060301164446+08'00'\", 'Creator': 'PScript5.dll Version 5.2', 'ModDate': \"D:20060301164446+08'00'\", 'Producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)', 'Title': 'Microsoft Word - The 48 Laws of Power_BIZ.doc', 'file_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Downloads\\\\48lawsofpower.pdf', 'page': 12, 'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Downloads\\\\48lawsofpower.pdf', 'total_pages': 17})]}"
